This project fetches and displays top stories from The New York Times using their public API. 
The frontend is built with Angular and dynamically loads stories such as titles, sections, abstracts, and multimedia content. 
The data is displayed in a grid format with hover effects for images, and the backend service handles API requests to get the data.
The application also includes error handling, a loading spinner, and a clean user interface for an optimal experience.
